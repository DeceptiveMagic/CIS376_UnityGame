This is a game created in Unity for CIS376 with Professor Ira Woodring
Groupmates: Gabe Kucinich, Trevor Martin, Jayson Willey

Description:
	A 3D FPS-type game based on Bloons Tower Defense. The
	player will control a monkey character who can move about
	a map, popping balloons with darts. The balloons will move 
	across a set path, coming in predetermined waves. Balloons
	will have differing amounts of health, and differing movement
	speeds. By popping the balloons, the player gains money which 
	may be spent on upgrades (attack speed, popping power, AI
	companions).
	The player wins if they surpass all rounds (by popping all 
	balloons) with lives remaining. The player loses if a balloon 
	reaches the end of the stage, reducing the player lives to 0.

Balloon Behavior:
	Red - 1 hp, 1 speed. 
	Blue - 2 hp, 2 speed. 
	Green - 3 hp, 3 speed. 
	Yellow - 4 hp, 4 speed.
	Pink - 5 hp, 5 speed.
	Purple - 1 hp, 7 speed.
