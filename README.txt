This is a game created in Unity for CIS376 with Professor Ira Woodring
Groupmates: Gabe Kucinich, Trevor Martin, __

The game is currently in concept stages where we are between 2 ideas:

1. 	A 3D peggle-type game with the player camera controlled
	similarly to a claw machine. The goal is to shoot balls and 
	collide with pegs to destroy all pegs. Each ball shot will 
	decrease the remaining ball counter (ammo count). The 
	player will have a chance to regain a ball if a ball in play
	falls into a moving catcher at the bottom.
	The player wins if all pegs are destroyed. The player loses
	if pegs remain when the player runs out of balls.

2.	A 3D FPS-type game based on Baloons Tower Defense 1. The
	player will control a monkey character who can move about
	a map, popping balloons with darts. The balloons will move 
	across a set path, coming in predetermined waves. Balloons
	will have differing amounts of health, and differing movement
	speeds. By popping the balloons the player gains money which 
	may be spent on upgrades (attack speed, popping power) and 
	evolutions (change from original dart monkey to a more 
	powerful attack pattern).
	The player wins if they pop all balloons before they 
	reach the end of the stage. The player loses if a balloon 
	reaches the end of the stage before the player can pop it.
